# 📚 Hindi Literature-Based Personalized Book Recommendation System

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a personalized book recommendation system designed especially for lovers of **Hindi literature and creative writing**. It simulates how recommendations evolve as readers interact with various literary titles — just like how a thoughtful librarian would suggest your next favorite book!

Whether you're into **Premchand’s social realism**, **Mahadevi Verma’s emotional poetry**, or **contemporary Hindi fiction**, this system starts with your preferences and gradually sharpens its recommendations as it learns from your reading taste.

## 🧭 How It Works
1. **📖 Cold Start**: Recommends books based on content (genre, tags) and popularity — great if you're new or exploring.
2. **🖱️ User Interaction**: You simulate interest by selecting books you like.
3. **🧠 Profile Update**: Your preferences — favorite genres and themes — are recorded and updated.
4. **🎯 Personalized Recommendations**: Based on what you love, the next round gives smarter, more relevant book suggestions.
5. **🤝 Hybrid Suggestions**: Combines your personal taste with insights from similar readers.
